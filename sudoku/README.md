# Sudoku in React

I quite enjoy sudoku puzzles and I like the idea of being able to make my own engine for playing sudoku.

My plan for this is to look at no tutorials/source code for Sudoku engines and see if I can build up the features to make this into a working application.

The aim of this is to practice what I have learnt so far on passing state and event handling. Eventually I'd like to give a go and building my own (probably quite brute force) sudoku solver. 

## Timeline:
- [x] Have a simple sudoku board in HTML/CSS in a board component (Completed 10/1/20)
- [x] Each value of the sudoku cells reflects the state of the board (Completed 10/1/20)
- [x] Number entry for each cell (Completed 13/1/20)
- [x] Check if solution is correct (Completed 13/1/20)
- [x] Load a new game from template (Completed 17/1/20)
- [x] Select a new game from a selection of dificulties (Completed 17/1/20)
- [ ] Style - Highlight the square, row and collumn of the selected cell
- [x] Style - Add 3x3 thick borders (Completed 4/2/20)
- [x] Style - Make numbers larger and bolder (Completed 4/2/20)
- [ ] Flashing animations for boxes or lines completed
- [ ] More exciting completed the game animation
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Confirmation for new game (If a square has been filled already)
