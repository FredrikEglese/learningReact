# Sudoku in React

I quite enjoy sudoku puzzles and I like the idea of being able to make my own engine for playing sudoku.

My plan for this is to look at no tutorials/source code for Sudoku engines and see if I can build up the features to make this into a working application.

The aim of this is to practice what I have learnt so far on passing state and event handling. Eventually I'd like to give a go and building my own (probably quite brute force) sudoku solver. 

## Timeline:
 - [] Have a simple sudoku board in HTML/CSS in a board component
 - [] Each value of the sudoku cells reflects the state of the board
 - [] Number entry for each cell
