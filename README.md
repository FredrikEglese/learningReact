# This repo is for my projects while learning ReactJS

## React tutorial

I have been through the React tutorials and docs ([here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)) to get an initial understanding of ReactJs. I followed along with the tutorial creating the `/tic-tac-old` and `/tick-tac-two` projects.

## Scratchpad

Any time I come across a new area of React, I have made `/scratch` for testing out features or syntax.

## Larger tasks

### Sudoku

> This has been moved to a seperate project now as it got quite large.

An engine for playing sudoku within react. My first self-lead project practicing state and event handling.

More detail found on the README within that directory.
