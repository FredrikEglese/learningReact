### This repo is for my little projects while learning React JS

I have been through the React tutorials and docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to get an initial understanding of ReactJs.

I followed along with the tutorial creating the tic-tac-old and tick-tac-two directories.

I then tried to make my own little components to get more used to react. Small ones are under `/scratch` where they are very short, and other slightly greater efforts are in their own projet files.
